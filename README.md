# SD2SNES_ALTTSM_Rando_AutoTracker
An automatically updating tracker for the Link to the Super Metroid Randomizer written in C#. The user must have the latest USB2SNES firmware on their SD2SNES installed and the USB port hooked to the computer where this runs. For now you need to wait until the game is active to run the tracker.

Requirements:

1.) Latest USB2SNES Firmware from Redguy Installed on your SD2SNES.

2.) usb2snescore.dll from Redguy's USB2SNES source.

3.) USB Cable attached to your PC.

4.) USB2SNES Software may be required on the PC but I am not 100% sure there.

Note: Make sure the USB2SNES software is not running on your PC or it will take ownership of the COM3 Port which this tracker relies on.

Usage:

1.) Hook up your SD2SNES to your PC via the USB Port near the SD Card slot.

2.) Power on your SNES.

3.) Load a LTTSM randomizer.

4.) Run ALTTSM_SD2SNES_Tracker.exe in the Bin Directory. 

Note: You must have usb2snescore.dll in this directory.

5.) Enjoy. :)
